Greetings!

I'm Luiz Gabriel, a seasoned software engineer from Fortaleza, Brazil, with a decade of experience spanning backend systems, mobile and big data solutions, and even game engines and compilers. Since 2014, my career has evolved from monolithic architectures to microservices and full-stack and mobile development, which has sharpened my understanding of scalable, efficient design. Leading cross-functional, remote teams, I’ve delivered solutions that prioritize performance and user experience.

My journey is driven by innovation and learning. I'm passionate about projects that challenge the traditional development landscape. I’ve created a cross-platform game engine and a compiler for a functional programming language, each designed to optimize performance with advanced cache-friendly structures and functional programming.
