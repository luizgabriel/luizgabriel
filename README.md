Greetings!

I'm Luiz Gabriel, a seasoned software engineer from Fortaleza, Brazil, with a decade of experience spanning backend systems, mobile and big data solutions, and even game engines and compilers. Since 2014, my career has evolved from monolithic architectures to microservices and full-stack and mobile development, which has sharpened my understanding of scalable, efficient design. Leading cross-functional, remote teams, I’ve delivered solutions that prioritize performance and user experience.

My journey is driven by innovation and learning. I'm passionate about projects that challenge the traditional development landscape. I’ve created a cross-platform game engine and a compiler for a functional programming language, each designed to optimize performance with advanced cache-friendly structures and functional programming.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀: 
⭑ 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲: A cross-platform game engine written in C++ on Google’s Filament rendering engine, with 72 stars on GitHub. This project was the theme of my thesis on "Game Engines and Cache-Friendly Data Structures for Real-Time Simulations." 
⭑ 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴: A compiler for a Turing-complete functional language in Rust with a REPL tool, using parser combinators and immutable data structures.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:
✔️ Backend & Full-Stack Engineering: Architected backend solutions with PHP, Laravel, and Python, specializing in ETL and AWS-based data processing.
✔️ Mobile Development: Built and migrated native iOS and Android applications to React Native, achieving reliable, user-centered mobile solutions.
✔️ Big Data & Distributed Systems: Designed optimized data systems with PostgreSQL, AWS Athena, Glue, and ETL pipelines.
✔️ Real-Time Systems: Created real-time chat and carpool matching systems with integrations to services like Uber and 99Taxi.
